    This website hosts the interface of an evoting system. This system runs smart contracts, handled by a set of Byzantine fault-tolerant nodes.
    <br />
    <br />
    When an administrator creates an election, the election parameters are saved on a blockchain and so are every following transaction (closing/cancelling election, casting a vote,...).
    <br />
    <br />
    A distributed key is generated at election creation time so that when a user votes, his/her vote is encrypted with the key guarantying the anonymity of the vote. However the system doesn't enforce the anonymity of the voter.
    <br />
    <br />
    When an election is closed, the nodes shuffle the ballots and check its correctness before decrypting the shuffle and publish the result of the election on a smart contract.
